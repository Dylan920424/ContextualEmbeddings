# ContextualEmbeddings
This paper investigates the potential for analogical reasoning in contextual embeddings of sentences, paragraphs, and documents. Building upon foundational models like Word2Vec, Doc2Vec, Lda2Vec, and Sentence-BERT, the study explores analogical reasoning capabilities and their applications in computational social sciences. Despite strong performance in semantic tasks, analogical reasoning in contextual embeddings remains underexplored. The experimental approach tests models on semantic text similarity datasets and finds success, however, embedding space probing and exploration revealed limited success in analogical reasoning. The discussion highlights the need for dedicated benchmarks and suggests applications such as personalized recommendation systems. While significant analogical relationships are not identified, the study emphasizes the importance of further exploration in this area.
